Today we're highlighting Ruby Water's new 2019 single "Supernatural". A Canadian singer/busker born to musical parents, Ruby Water's breakout hit is nothing short of stunning. Mixing acoustic strumming with gritty lyrics and a quick bass track, I can't reccomend this song enough. 

We can't stop blasting it. Listen with caution though, as this track is NSFW speakers.
