Today we're throwing back to the 1989 KwamÃ© hit, "The Rythym" off his album, "KwamÃ© the Boy Genius: Featuring a New Beginning". This album peaked at number 114 on the Billboard 200 chart but what an underrated gem. Steve Huey at Allmusic called the album's production "bright, appealing, and funky," and remarked that KwamÃ© himself was "a sorely neglected figure today, even among fans of playful, intellectual hip-hop." I think it I love it so much because it reminds me of De La Soul. 

Give it a listen! It's one of those songs that you just can't help but move to. See you tomorrow!
