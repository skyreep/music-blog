{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Today we're highlighting The Claypool Lennon Delirium's new album \"South of Reality\". If you haven't heard of the Claypool\nLennon Delirium it's a group consisting of Les Claypool of Primus, and John Lennon &#x26; Yoko Ono's son Sean Lennon. Their 2016 debut album, \"The Monolith of Phobos\" was psychadelic and stunning. \"South of Reality\" showcases their talent while calling back memories of psychadelic classics like the White Album, and Pet Sounds. Where \"The Monolith of Phobos\" focused on trippy imagery, \"South of Reality\" intertwines it with modern commentary on a variety of societal and environmental issues facing their audience in 2019. </p>\n<p>The \"South of Reality\" vinyl is particularly stunning. Today's post in particular focuses on the 1500 issue limited teal and magenta splatter colorway. Semi-opaque, while maintaining 180 grams, this album is one of ATO records few must have pressings. The icing on the cake is the incredible zoetrope label which is unique on all 4 sides. This special type of label appears animated when subjected to a timed strobe. It's honestly impossible to accurately describe, so I'll leave it to the video.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"reddit-card\" data-card-created=\"1554673693\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl/comments/atmlqu/the_claypool_lennon_delirium_south_of_reality/\">The Claypool Lennon Delirium â€” South of Reality (splatter vinyl with zoetrope labels)</a> from <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/vinyl\">r/vinyl</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script>","frontmatter":{"title":"Vinyl Spotlight - Episode 1"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/vr-dev-welcome/"}}
